# XIAO RP2040

## RP2040 - Analog sensor - MCP9701
[MCP9701](https://store.comet.bg/Catalogue/Product/5003942/) family of sensors with Linear Active Thermistor Integrated Circuit
(IC) comprise a family of analog temperature sensors that convert temperature to analog voltage.
The low-cost, low-power sensors feature an accuracy of ±1°C from +20°C to +70°C (MCP9700B), ±2°C from
0°C to +70°C (MCP9700A/9701A) and ±4°C from 0°C to +70°C (MCP9700/9701) while consuming 6 µA (typical) of operating current.
 
## RP2040 - Digital sensor - DHT11
[DHT11](https://store.comet.bg/Catalogue/Product/50012/) is basic, ultra low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. 
It uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding air and spits out a digital signal on the data pin 
(no analog input pins needed). It's fairly simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data.
### Libraries for DHT11
- [DHT lib](https://github.com/adidax/dht11)
## Used Software
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)  Version 2.3.6
